<h3># Algotrading</h3>
A trading assistant to make good decision for trading. Strategies are inspired from the book "Short term strategies that work" by Larry Connors.

I have used
<ul>
  <li>Alpaca Trading API for getting the data, buying and selling stocks.</li>
  <li>Pandas for data manipulation</li>
  <li>Plotly for data visualisation</li>
</ul>

<i><b>Feel free to use my code. You can remove the import cred line and add the api keys directly. Also, can change the symbol for checking other companies</i></b><br>
<b>Work is in progress</b>
